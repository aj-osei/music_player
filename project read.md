**Overview**
This project is a simple music player built in Java. It allows users to play, stop, reset, and quit an audio file. The program currently supports .wav, .au, and .aiff file formats. The interface is console-based, making it straightforward and easy to use for beginners.

**Features**
Play (P): Plays the music from the current position.
Stop (S): Pauses the music.
Reset (R): Restarts the music from the beginning.
Quit (Q): Stops the music and exits the program.

**How to Use**
-Add the desired audio file to the specified path in the code (filePath variable).
-Run the program.
-Use the following commands to interact with the music player:
  -P to play the audio.
  -S to stop the audio.
  -R to reset the audio.
  -Q to quit the program.

**Error Handling**
The program includes error handling for:
  -Missing audio files.
  -Unsupported audio file formats.
  -Issues accessing audio resources.

**Future Improvements**
Here are the planned features to enhance the music player:

Playlist Support:
  Allow users to load multiple audio files into a playlist.
  Automatically play the next song when the current one finishes.

Song Skipping:
  Add commands to skip to the next song or go back to the previous one.
  Display the current song name during playback.

Loop and Shuffle:
  Introduce looping to repeat songs or playlists.
  Add a shuffle feature to play songs in random order.

User-Friendly Interface:
  Upgrade from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for each function.
